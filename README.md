# Top Down Shooter

Here are the current dynamics of the game (subject to change):
- The player(s) will eliminate waves of enemies incoming from all directions, and each wave will get progressively more difficult
- The player will be highly customizable; they may have attributes which can be ‘upgradeable’ by earning points from defeating waves
- By requesting to join a lobby, the character can play online with other players
- The player’s gun will have several attributes:
    - The type of weapon can be selected: semi-auto, full-auto, or shotgun (and maybe 3-round burst?)
    - By determining the type of weapon, the gun’s accuracy, damage, kick, bullet speed, and the rate of fire
    - The gun will have unlimited ‘clips’, but will be limited by the size of the clip
