# What do we need in the gun object?
- Accuracy
- ~~Kick~~
- ~~Damage~~
- ~~Bullet Speed~~
- ~~Rate of fire~~
- ~~Type (Semi-Auto, Auto, Shotgun)~~

# Proposed class system by janka102:
 - Entity
    - Character
        - Player
        - Enemy/Mob
    - Bullet
    - Wall/Barrier
    - Item
        - Gun
        - Coin/Power-up/etc.??

# Misc. (order of importance)
- Should we move from Floobits to Koding/Nitrous.io?
    - Even though Floobits says it handles images, it seems to be having problems.
    - Easy previewing of the website
    - We would have a server to do server stuff on.
- MODULARIZE THE DAMN JS FILE!!!!! (put each object in a separate file)
- Fix the bloated crosshairs stuff. Some of that code belongs in the input object.
